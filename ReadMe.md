# Malware classification

This paper utilizes deep learning to classify the families of malware for Portable Executable 32 (PE32). More on paper.docx

# Sample Collection and Contribution:
Most samples are collected from various github repositories where the malware has been classified already. Thanks to VirusSign and VirusShare for providing access to huge range of malware collection. Most of the malware which is classified already and not classified is double checked by me to make sure the data is good enough to train a neural network. Current we have some samples(worm, downloader, keylogger and crypto-miner) lagging. These variants are hard to find. For example I have found about more than 300 samples of worm after analysing them, I found out they are all one single sample (Allaple) a polymorphic worm which makes copy of itself and every sample's copy is different in content as well as hash, But it is all one single worm (Allaple). This creates data duplication which affects the model badly as it relies heavily on those features. So finding unqiue worms have become highly difficult from repositories like VirusSign etc., If you ever have some of the collections kindly contribute by creating a pull request with the imports txt file alone (No EXE).

# Abstract
A malware is a computer program which harms the computer in which it gets executed. Malware analysis play a major role in analysing the functionalities and behaviour of the malware. Malware analysis is a slow and tedious process which involves a lot of manual work. Finding the type of the malware will often boost up the analysis process and helps to the researcher to know what the binary is capable of. Usually researchers perform various static analysis techniques to find the category of the malware using various tools like strings, dependency walker etc., But each day there are millions [1] of new malwares gets released classifying them manually is a non-feasible solution. So, in our approach we are going to automate this process using deep neural networks.

# I. INTRODUCTION
Malware analysis helps the researchers to find out the functionality of the malware. Malware analysis comprises of two major types,
1.	Static Malware analysis.
2.	Dynamic Malware analysis.

## Static Malware Analysis
In static malware analysis the malicious binaries are examined without executing and may be further subjected for reverse engineering using disassembler. Where as in dynamic malware analysis the malicious binary is actually executed in an isolated environment like sandbox to detect its behaviour.

## Keywords:
Windows Malware, Malware Analysis, Static Malware Analysis, Malware Classification.

## A. Types of malware:

## 1. Backdoor:
	Backdoor is a malicious program which allows the remote attacker to gain access to the victim’s computer.
## 2. Downloader:
	The sole purpose of the downloader is to download another malicious program and sometimes execute it.
## 3. Keylogger:
	A keylogger is a program which continuously monitors the keystroke of the user. This helps the attacker to steal potential information like email address, password., etc.,
## 4. Miners:
	This malicious program will use the resources of the victim’s computer to mine crypto-currency which is used to monetize the attacker’s wallet.
## 5. Rouge software:
	Rouge software seems to behave like an original software say, antivirus and will trick the user to buy services which will end up paying to an attacker.
## 6. Trojan:
	A trojan is a software which seems to behave like a legitimate program but does malicious activities in the background.
## 7. Ransomware:
	A malicious program which encrypts the user’s files (pictures, documents, etc.,) and would demand a ransom for decryption. The ransom is generally collected through cryptocurrency like Bitcoins, Dash, etc.,
